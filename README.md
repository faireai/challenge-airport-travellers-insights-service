## Assignment

- [ ] Complete the documentation of the API updating the OpenAPI we provide by
      designing the missing parts.
- [ ] Implement the service operations as described in section
      [Service capabilities](#service-capabilities).
- [ ] Implement tests to verify that correctness of the service functionalities.
- [ ] Add instructions to build a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container
      image containing the service and explain how to launch it.
      Document it in section [Run with Docker](#run-with-docker) within this
      page.
- [ ] Upload the code to a public repository or a private one after granting the
      access to [gilberto@faire.ai](mailto:gilberto@faire.ai) (Head of
      Technology @ *faireai*) that may request the access for other colleagues
      for the review.

**Note.** During the implementation you can change any file of this project.
What we provide is a service scaffold with the purpose of the simplifying the
development of the service.
If something can be enhanced, any valuable improvement will be appreciated. 

### What we evaluate

During the evaluation of your implementation we pay attention to the following
points.

- Correctness of the business logic.
- Quality of the code with a focus on its readability.
- Architecture of the service.
- Proper tests code coverage and use of tests.

TODO Implementation must be pushed to a public repository or to a private one
that must guarantee the access to some specific developers at *faireai*.

## Build

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as build tool.
It makes easy to build the service and launch it.

To compile and verify the project run:

```shell
% ./gradlew clean check
```

## Configuration

*TODO Document how to configure the service.*

## Run the service

The service can be launched running the following command:

```shell
% ./gradlew bootRun
```

### Run with Docker

*TODO Document how to run the service using Docker.*

## Usage

*TODO Explain how to use the service and provide examples.*

## Extras

- TODO Explain here that if the candidate uses GitHub she/he can take advantage
